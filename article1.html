        <h2>The Basics of Calorie Counting</h2>
        <p>
          Calorie counting is a fundamental aspect of many weight management
          strategies. At its core, it's about understanding the energy content
          of the foods you consume and balancing it with your body's energy
          expenditure. One calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the
          temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.

          The average adult needs between 1,600 to 3,000 calories per day, depending on
          various factors like age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.
          To lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit, consuming fewer
          calories than your body burns. 
          
          Conversely, to gain weight, you need a calorie surplus. While calorie counting can be effective, it's
          important to remember that not all calories are created equal. 100
          calories of broccoli will affect your body differently than 100
          calories of chocolate. 
          
          Focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins and minerals along with their calories. Use apps or
          food diaries to track your intake, and don't forget to account for
          beverages, cooking oils, and snacks. Remember, sustainable weight
          management is about creating healthy, long-term habits, not just
          short-term restrictions.

        <h2>The Role of Exercise in Calorie Management</h2>
        <p>
          Exercise plays a crucial role in calorie management and overall
          health. While diet is often considered the primary factor in weight
          control, physical activity is equally important for maintaining a
          healthy weight and improving body composition. When you exercise, your
          body burns calories to fuel your activity. The number of calories
          burned depends on factors like the type of exercise, intensity,
          duration, and your body weight. For example, a 30-minute jog might
          burn around 300 calories for an average adult, while the same time
          spent weightlifting might burn 200 calories. However, the benefits of
          exercise extend beyond immediate calorie burning. Regular physical
          activity increases your metabolic rate, meaning you burn more calories
          even when at rest. It also helps preserve and build lean muscle mass,
          which is more metabolically active than fat tissue. Moreover, exercise
          offers numerous health benefits beyond calorie management. It improves
          cardiovascular health, strengthens bones and muscles, enhances mood
          and mental health, and reduces the risk of various diseases. For
          effective calorie management, aim for a combination of cardio
          exercises for calorie burning and strength training to build muscle.
          The CDC recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75
          minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with
          muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.

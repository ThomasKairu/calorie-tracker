        <h2>Understanding Macronutrients</h2>
        <p>
          Macronutrients, often referred to as "macros," are the three main
          categories of nutrients your body needs in large amounts:
          carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each plays a crucial role in your
          body's functioning and overall health. Carbohydrates are your body's
          primary source of energy. They come in two main types: simple (like
          sugar) and complex (like whole grains). Complex carbs are generally
          healthier as they provide sustained energy and are often rich in
          fiber. Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues,
          making enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. They're
          made up of amino acids, some of which your body can't produce on its
          own, making dietary protein crucial. Fats, contrary to popular belief,
          are vital for health. They help absorb certain vitamins, provide
          energy, and support cell growth. Focus on healthy fats from sources
          like avocados, nuts, and olive oil, while limiting saturated and trans
          fats. The right balance of macros depends on individual factors like
          age, sex, weight, and activity level. Generally, a balanced diet
          consists of 45-65% carbohydrates, 10-35% protein, and 20-35% fat.
          Experiment to find the ratio that helps you feel your best and meet
          your health goals.
